# Critical Thinking and Rational Thought
The basis for philosophy is in discussing **claims** and **arguments**. In this sense, a philosophical argument is not necessarily the same
as a dispute or quarrel, but a collection of facts that support or refute claims.

If it has not been clear, words differ based on context. There are words that will have one meaning when speaking mathematically, another 
meaning when speaking scientifically, another meaning when speaking philosophically, and yet other meanings when used in natural speech. It
is important to understand the distinctions when they are presented; otherwise, what is being said can be diluted.

So, philosophically, we will define the following:

<dl>
  <dt>Truth-value</dt>
  <dd>A valuation of certainty or confidence, usually given values true and false, but it rare cases, may also be assigned values such as unknown
    - Hello
  </dd>
  <dt>Statement</dt>
  <dd>A sentence that has a truth value</dd>
</dl>
